# Climate Change Indicators Analysis (2000–2023)

This project analyzes global climate change indicators using the **Our World in Data (OWID) CO₂ and Greenhouse Gas Emissions** dataset. 
The aim is to tell a compelling story through data by exploring trends in carbon emissions, energy use, and temperature change from 2000 to 2023.

## Files Included

- `owid-co2-data.csv`: The main dataset used for analysis.
- `climate_analysis.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing all code (data cleaning, visualization, summary statistics).
- `summary_statistics.csv`: Table of key descriptive statistics.
- `temperature_trend.png`: Line plot of average temperature change from CO₂ (2000–2023).
- `co2_vs_energy.png`: Scatter plot of CO₂ per capita vs. energy use per capita.
- `top10_emitters.png`: Bar chart of top 10 CO₂ emitters per capita (2023).
- `correlation_heatmap.png`: Heatmap showing relationships among all variables.

## Key Indicators Analyzed

- **CO₂ Emissions per Capita (tons)**
- **Energy Use per Capita (kWh equivalent)**
- **Temperature Change from CO₂ (°C)**

## Summary of Findings

- Countries with higher energy use tend to emit more CO₂ per person.
- Average temperature change from CO₂ shows a consistent upward trend.
- Emission levels are more closely tied to warming than energy use alone.
- Emission disparities between countries highlight global climate inequality.

## Tools & Libraries

- Python 3.x
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Seaborn
- Matplotlib
- SciPy

## Project Goals

- Practice advanced data handling using real-world climate data.
- Create clear and meaningful visualizations.
- Interpret the data accurately to meet academic requirements.
